# Grocery_Full_stack_web_app
using python flask and sqlite,html,css,javascript(full stack web application)
Welcome to my Flask Full-Stack Grocery Application repository! This web application is designed to showcase a full-stack project that integrates a Python back end with Flask, a database (SQLite), and a dynamic front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hosted on the Render Platform, this application allows users to browse and manage grocery items, add them to a shopping cart, remove items, and automatically save all changes to the database.

You can access the live version of the app here: https://grocery-by-pk.onrender.com
